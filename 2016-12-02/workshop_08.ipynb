    "I first created a model by the use of INKSCAPE software, creating different SVG'files each representing a different part of the house, such as exterior walls, interior walls, doors, windows, and the floor for every room in the house . After generating the SVG'files and modified appropriately by removing the various tags, they were \"drag and drop\" on the support software that generated the lines's files. The latter were used in the function created by me to generate arrays of dots through the use of the function \"lines2lines\" present in larlib. After extracting the data, I used the functions: 'POLYLINE', 'OFFSET', 'QUOTE', 'PROD' to generate the various hpc object. At this point I made a STRUCT between interior and exterior walls, to which I am going to make a DIFFERENCE with the doors and windows (windows appropriately shifted the axis of z). At the end to make everything more beautiful, i added some texture to any room. The final model misures about 20x20x4mt (LxPxA)."
