    "<h4>Description of the geometric methods i'm going to implement:</h4>\n",
    "For this workshop I went to implement a parametric function that will build a multistorey house, attracting many of the workshops previously developed and adjusted. The main function is to three levels, the first takes as input the house number (required for the next workshop for the creation of multiple parametric houses), the second takes in input the path for the .lines files for all the two floor of the house, the third takes in input 5 arrays, each of which will contain different colors for the various elements of the house, so that each house will be structurally the same, but with different colors! Recalling the old functions, I'm going to create the structure of the first floor from .lines, add the scales appropriately shifted, same thing for doors and windows. Then I'm going to add the ceiling and the second floor (which in turn will appropriately translated doors and windows), then finished with the second-floor ceiling and the roof terrace. What makes the main function essentially is to call all of the old workshop methods to create the various parts of the house, translating and rotating the whole. It ends with a STRUCT the first floor + stairs + ceiling + second floor + ceiling + roof terrace."
